Coravel makes advanced application features accessible and easy-to-use by giving you a simple, 
expressive and straightforward syntax - helping developers get their .NET Core applications up-and-running fast without compromising code quality.

## Features:

### Task Scheduling

Usually, you have to configure a cron job or a task via Windows Task Scheduler to get a single or multiple re-occurring tasks to run.

With Coravel, you can setup all your scheduled tasks in one place using a simple, elegant, fluent syntax - in code!

### Queuing

Coravel gives you a zero-configuration queue that runs in-memory to offload long-winded tasks to the background instead of making your users wait for their HTTP request to finish!

### Caching

Coravel provides you with an easy to use API for caching in your .NET Core applications.

By default, it uses an in-memory cache, but also has database drivers for more robust scenarios!

### Event Broadcasting

Coravel's event broadcasting helps you to build maintainable applications who's parts are loosely coupled!

### Mailing

E-mails are not as easy as they should be. Luckily for you, Coravel solves this by offering:

- Built-in e-mail friendly razor templates
- Simple and flexible mailing API
- Render your e-mails for visual testing
- Drivers supporting SMTP, local log file or BYOM ("bring your own mailer") driver
- Quick and simple configuration via `appsettings.json`
- And more!
