# Queuing

[[toc]]

Coravel gives you a zero-configuration queue that runs in-memory. 

This is useful to offload long-winded tasks to the background instead of making your users wait for their HTTP request to finish.

## Setup

In your `Startup` file, in the `ConfigureServices()`:

```csharp
services.AddQueue();
```

Then you inject an instance of the `Coravel.Queuing.Interfaces.IQueue` interface into your controller, etc.

```csharp
IQueue _queue;

public HomeController(IQueue queue) {
    this._queue = queue;
}
```

## Queuing Jobs
### Queuing Invocables

To queue an invocable, use `QueueInvocable`:

```csharp
this._queue.QueueInvocable<GrabDataFromApiAndPutInDBInvocable>();
```

:::tip
Queuing invocables is the recommended way to use Coravel's queuing.

### Queue With A Payload

Many times you want to queue a background job and also supply a payload/parameters.

For example, you might have an invocable `SendWelcomeUserEmailInvocable`. However, you need to supply a specific user's information so that the correct user will receive the email!

First, add the `IInvocableWithPayload<T>` interface to your existing invocable:

```csharp
                                                         // This one ðŸ‘‡
public class SendWelcomeUserEmailInvocable : IInvocable, IInvocableWithPayload<UserModel>
{
  // This is the implementation of the interface ðŸ‘‡
  public UserModel Payload { get; set; }

  /* Constructor, etc. */

  public async Task Invoke()
  {
    // `this.Payload` will be available to use now.
  }
}
```

To queue this invocable, use the `QueueInvocableWithPayload` method:

```csharp
var userModel = await _userService.Get(userId);
queue.QueueInvocableWithPayload<SendWelcomeUserEmailInvocable, UserModel>(userModel);
```

Now your job will be queued to execute in the background with the specific data it needs to run!

### Queuing Async

Use the `QueueAsyncTask` to queue up an async task:

```csharp
 this._queue.QueueAsyncTask(async() => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    Console.WriteLine("This was queued!");
 });
```

### Queuing Synchronously

You use the `QueueTask()` method to add a  task to the queue.

```csharp
public IActionResult QueueTask() {
    this._queue.QueueTask(() => Console.WriteLine("This was queued!"));
    return Ok();
}
```

### Queue Event Broadcast

Event broadcasting is great - but what if your event listeners are doing some heavy / long-winded tasks? You don't want that to happen on the same thread as your HTTP request!

By using `QueueBroadcast`, you can queue an event to be broadcasted in the background.

```csharp
this._queue.QueueBroadcast(new OrderCreated(orderId)); 
```

### Queuing Cancellable Invocables

Sometimes you have a long-running invocable that needs the ability to be cancelled (manually by you or by the system when the application is being shutdown).

By using `QueueCancellableInvocable` you can build invocables that can be cancelled:

```csharp
 var (taskGuid, token) = queue.QueueCancellableInvocable<CancellableInvocable>();
 
 // Somewhere else....

 token.Cancel();
```

Add the `Coravel.Queuing.Interfaces.ICancellableTask` to your invocable and implement the property:

`CancellationToken Token { get; set; }`

In your `Invoke` method, you will have access to check if the token has been cancelled.

```csharp
while(!this.Token.IsCancellationRequested)
{
  await ProcessNextRecord();
}
```
## Metrics

You can gain some insight into how the queue is doing at a given moment in time.

```csharp
var metrics = _queue.GetMetrics();
```

Available methods:

- `WaitingCount()`: The number of tasks waiting to be executed.
- `RunningCount()`: The number of tasks currently running.

## Tracking Task Progress

Most of the methods on the `IQueue` interface will return a `Guid` that represents the unique id for the task you pushed to the queue. Also, Coravel's queue exposes some internal events that you can hook into. 

Combining these: you can create listeners for the events `QueueTaskStarted` and `QueueTaskCompleted` that verify the progress of specific tasks in real-time. When a task/job crashes, then the event `DequeuedTaskFailed` will be emitted. Creating a listener for this one might be helpful too.

A basic listener that notifies some user interface of task progress might look something like this:

```csharp
public class TaskStartedListener : IListener<QueueTaskStarted>
{
    // Constructor etc.

    public async Task HandleAsync(QueueTaskStarted broadcasted)
    {
        await this._uiNotifications.NotifyTaskStarted(broadcasted.Guid);
    }
}
```

## Global Error Handling

In the `Configure` method of your `Startup` file:

```csharp
var provider = app.ApplicationServices;
provider
    .ConfigureQueue()
    .OnError(e =>
    {
        //... handle the error
    });
```

## Adjusting Consummation Delay

Normally, the queue will consume all of its queued tasks every 30 seconds.
You can adjust this delay in the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
"Coravel": {
  "Queue": {
    "ConsummationDelay": 1
  }
}
```

## Logging Task Progress

Coravel uses the `ILogger` .NET Core interface to allow logging task progress:

```csharp
var provider = app.ApplicationServices;
provider
    .ConfigureQueue()
    .LogQueuedTaskProgress(provider.GetService<ILogger<IQueue>>());
```
