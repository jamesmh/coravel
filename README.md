__Note: Coravel is unstable as it's in the "early" stages of development. Once version 2 is released Coravel will be considered stable. Please use with this in mind :)__

Inspired by all the awesome features that are baked into the Laravel PHP framework - coravel seeks to provide additional features to .Net Core apps so you can get started building the "meat" of your app and avoid getting tied up configuring additional infrastructure (mail, cache, scheduling, etc.)

Right now, Coravel features:

## Contributing

If you are fixing a typo in one file / place - issue a PR. 

Otherwise, please **always** create an issue first ;)

### Coravel-Cli

Ideally, use the [Coravel Cli](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel/blob/master/Docs/Cli.md) to get started! 

Coravel Cli is a dotnet core tool that you can use as a global executable (similar to `npm` or `dotnet` etc.) that gives you easy installs, scaffolding abilities, etc.

Install the tool:

```
dotnet tool install --global coravel-cli
```

### Installation

With the cli:

```
coravel install
```

Alternatively, add the nuget package `Coravel` to your .NET Core app.

Done!
