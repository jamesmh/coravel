## Requirements

Coravel is a .Net Core library. You must be including Coravel in an existing .Net Core application (version 2.1.0 +).

### Coravel-Cli

Use the [Coravel Cli](./Docs/Cli.md) to get started!

Coravel Cli is a dotnet core tool that you can use as a global executable (similar to `npm` or `dotnet` etc.) that gives you easy installs, scaffolding abilities, etc.

Install the tool:

```
dotnet tool install --global coravel-cli
```

### Installation

Coravel requires a few dependencies that the cli will manage for you.

To install Coravel, run:

```
coravel install
```

Done!
