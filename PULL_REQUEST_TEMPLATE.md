Thank you for your contribution!
Before submitting this PR, please make sure:

- [ ] If you are fixing something **other than a typo**, **please always create an issue first**. 
      Otherwise, your PR will probably be rejected
- [ ] Your addition is not too large. The more files/lOC changed means the longer it'll take to be addressed by me (the maintainer)
- [ ] Your code builds clean without any errors or warnings
- [ ] You have added user documentation for any additional features
- [ ] You have added unit tests which (a) pass and (b) sufficiently cover your changes

Other Notes:

Coravel is created with a specific vision and philosophy:

- Simple, fluent and straightforward public APIs
- Easy to read documentation that guides users coherently
- Building **useful** features because they really are useful - not just for the sake of adding "more features"

To that effect, don't feel bad when many changes are asked of your PR ðŸ˜‰
