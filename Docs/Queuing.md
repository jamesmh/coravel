# Task Queuing

Coravel allows zero-configuration queues (at run time).

Every 30 seconds, if there are any available items in the queue, they will be dequeued.

## Setup

In your `Startup` file, in the `ConfigureServices()` just do this:

```c#
services.AddQueue();
```

That's it! This will automatically register the queue in your service container.

## How To Queue Tasks

In your controller that is using DI, inject a `Coravel.Queuing.Interfaces.IQueue`.

You use the `QueueTask()` method to add a task to the queue.

```c#
IQueue _queue;

public HomeController(IQueue queue) {
    this._queue = queue;
}

//... Further down ...

public IActionResult QueueTask() {
    // Call .QueueTask() to add item to the queue!
    this._queue.QueueTask(() => Console.WriteLine("This was queued!"));
    return Ok();
}
```

## Queue Async Task

Use the `QueueAsyncTask` to queue up an async Task (which will run async whenever the queue is consumed).

```c#
 this._queue.QueueAsyncTask(async() => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    Console.WriteLine("This was queued!");
 });
```

## Queue Invocables

To learn about creating and using invocables [see the docs.](./Invocables.md)

To queue an invocable, use `QueueInvocable`:

```c#
this._queue.QueueInvocable<GrabDataFromApiAndPutInDBInvocable>();
```

## Global Error Handling

> In version 1.9 `ConfigureQueue` was moved as an extension method of `IServiceProvider`.
> This allows Coravel's dependencies to be significantly slimmed down ðŸ‘Œ

In the `Configure` method of your `Startup` file, first call `app.ApplicationServices.ConfigureQueue()` and further chain the `OnError()` method to register a global error handler.

```c#
var provider = app.ApplicationServices;
provider
    .ConfigureQueue()
    .OnError(e =>
    {
        //.... handle the error
    });
```

## Adjusting The Consummation Delay

Normally, the queue will consume all of it's queued tasks every 30 seconds.
You can adjust this delay in the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
"Coravel": {
  "Queue": {
    "ConsummationDelay": 1
  }
}
```

## Logging Executed Task Progress

Coravel uses the `ILogger` .NET Core interface to allow logging task progress.

Enable logging by further chaining off the `ConfigureQueue` method, grabbing a logger from the service provider and passing it into `LogQueuedTaskProgress`:

```c#
var provider = app.ApplicationServices;
provider
    .ConfigureQueue()
    .LogQueuedTaskProgress(provider.GetService<ILogger<IQueue>>());
```

## On App Closing

When your app is stopped, Coravel will consume any tasks remaining in the queue and/or wait until all long-running tasks are completed.

Of course - if your server was shutdown in a non-graceful way etc. (unplugged... etc.) then you may lose active queued tasks.
