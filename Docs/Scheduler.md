**_Note: I plan on overhauling the scheduling piece of Coravel very soon. It was a proof of concept (the first feature of Coravel) created to see if others were interested in such a project. The response has been very positive - so I will be implementing additional features and fixing issues with the current design (distributed abilities, fixing concurrency issues, etc.) which probably means breaking changes. Please use with this in mind ;)_**

# Task Scheduling

Usually, you have to configure a cron job or a task via Windows Task Scheduler to get a single or multiple re-occuring tasks to run. With coravel you can setup all your scheduled tasks in one place! And it's super easy to use!

## Initial Setup

In your .NET Core app's `Startup.cs` file, inside the `ConfigureServices()` method, add the following:

```c#
services.AddScheduler(scheduler =>
    {
        scheduler.Schedule(
            () => Console.WriteLine("Every minute during the week.")
        )
        .EveryMinute();
        .Weekday();
    }
);
```

This will run the task (which prints to the console) every minute and only on weekdays (not Sat or Sun). Simple enough?

## How Does It Work?

The `AddScheduler()` method will configure a new Hosted Service that will run in the background while your app is running.

A `Scheduler` is provided to you for configuring what tasks you want to schedule. You may use the `Schedule()` and `ScheduleAsync()` methods to schedule a task.

After calling `Schedule()` you can chain method calls further to specify:

- The interval of when your task should be run (once a minute? every hour? etc.)
- Specific times when you want your task to run
- Restricting which days your task is allowed to run on (Monday's only? etc.)

Example: Run a task once an hour only on Mondays.

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Hourly on Mondays.")
)
.Hourly()
.Monday();
```

Example: Run a task every day at 1pm

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Daily at 1 pm.")
)
.DailyAtHour(13); // Or .DailyAt(13, 00)
```

## Scheduling Tasks

After you have called the `Schedule()` method on the `Scheduler`, you can begin to configure the schedule constraints of your task.

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Scheduled task.")
)
.EveryMinute();
```

## Scheduling Async Tasks

Coravel will also handle scheduling async methods by using the `ScheduleAsync()` method. Note that this doesn't need to be awaited - the method or Func you provide _itself_ must be async (as it will be invoked by the scheduler at a later time).

```c#
scheduler.ScheduleAsync(async () =>
{
    await Task.Delay(500);
    Console.WriteLine("async task");
})
.EveryMinute();
```

Note, that you are able to register an async method when using `Schedule()` by mistake. Always use `ScheduleAsync()` when registering an async method.

## Scheduling Tasks Dynamically

You can add new scheduled tasks by using the `IScheduler` interface. Just inject the interface wherever DI is available.

## Intervals

First, methods to apply interval constraints are available.

### Basic Intervals

These methods tell your task to execute at basic intervals.

Using any of these methods will cause the task to be executed immedately after your app has started. Then they will only be
executed again once the specific interval has been reached.

If you restart your app these methods will cause all tasks to run again on start. To avoid this, use an interval method with time constraints (see below).

- `EveryMinute();`
- `EveryFiveMinutes();`
- `EveryTenMinutes();`
- `EveryFifteenMinutes();`
- `EveryThirtyMinutes();`
- `Hourly();`
- `Daily();`
- `Weekly();`

### Intervals With Time Contraints

These methods allow you specify an interval and a time constraint so that your scheduling is more specific and consistent.

_Please note that the scheduler is using UTC time. So, for example, using `DailyAt(13, 00)` will run your task daily at 1pm UTC time._

- `HourlyAt(int minute)`
- `DailyAtHour(int hour)`
- `DailyAt(int hour, int minute)`

## Day Constraints

After specifying an interval, you can further chain to restrict what day(s) the scheduled task is allowed to run on.

All these methods are further chainable - like `Monday().Wednesday()`. This would mean only running the task on Mondays and Wednesdays. Be careful since you could do something like this `.Weekend().Weekday()` which basically means there are no constraints (it runs on any day).

- `Monday()`
- `Tuesday()`
- `Wednesday()`
- `Thursday()`
- `Friday()`
- `Saturday()`
- `Sunday()`
- `Weekday()`
- `Weekend()`

## Global Error Handling

Any tasks that throw errors __will just be skipped__ and the next task in line will be invoked.

If you want to catch errors and do something specific with them you may use the `OnError()` method.

```c#
services.AddScheduler(scheduler =>
    // Assign your schedules
)
.OnError((exception) =>
    doSomethingWithException(exception)
);
```

You can, of course, add error handling inside your specific tasks too.

## Logging Executed Task Progress

Coravel uses the `ILogger` .Net Core interface to allow logging scheduled task progress.

In your `Startup.cs` file, you need to inject an instance of `IServiceProvider` to the constructor and assign it to a member field / property:

```c#
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, /* Add this */ IServiceProvider services)
{
    Configuration = configuration;
    Services = services;
}

public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

/* Add this property */
public IServiceProvider Services { get; }
```

Next, do ths following:

```c#
services.AddScheduler(scheduler =>
{
    // Assign scheduled tasks...
})
.LogScheduledTaskProgress(Services.GetService<ILogger<IScheduler>>());
```

The `LogScheduledTaskProgress()` method accepts an instance of `ILogger<IScheduler>`, which is available through the service provider.
