# Task Scheduling

Usually, you have to configure a cron job or a task via Windows Task Scheduler to get a single or multiple re-occurring tasks to run. With Coravel you can setup all your scheduled tasks in one place using a simple, elegant, fluent syntax.

Scheduling is now a breeze!

## Initial Setup

In your .NET Core app's `Startup.cs` file, inside the `ConfigureServices()` method, add the following:

```c#
services.AddScheduler()
```

> In version 1.9 `UseScheduler` was moved as an extension method of `IServiceProvider`.
> This allows Coravel's dependencies to be significantly slimmed down ðŸ‘Œ

Then in the `Configure()` method, you can use the scheduler:

```c#
var provider = app.ApplicationServices;
provider.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
{
    scheduler.Schedule(
        () => Console.WriteLine("Every minute during the week.")
    )
    .EveryMinute();
    .Weekday();
});
```

Simple enough?

## Overview / "Nice To Knows"
After calling `Schedule()` you can chain method calls further to specify:

- The interval of when your task should be run (once a minute? every hour? etc.)
- Specific times when you want your task to run
- Restricting which days your task is allowed to run on (Monday's only? etc.)
- Other restrictions such as preventing a long running task from running again while
  the previous one is still active.

> Under the covers, all scheduling is similar to cron. Using `EveryFiveMinutes()`, for example, will trigger only when the minute is 0, 5, 10, 15, etc.

## A Few Samples

### Example: Run a task once an hour only on Mondays.

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Hourly on Mondays.")
)
.Hourly()
.Monday();
```

### Example: Run a task every day at 1pm

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Daily at 1 pm.")
)
.DailyAtHour(13); // Or .DailyAt(13, 00)
```

### Example: Run a task on the first day of the month.

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("First day of the month.")
)
.Cron("0 0 1 * *") // At midnight on the 1st day of each month.
```

## Scheduler / Scheduling Tasks

After you have called the `Schedule()` method from the `Scheduler`, you can begin to configure the various constraints of your task.

For example:

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Scheduled task.")
)
.EveryMinute();
```

## Scheduling Async Tasks

Coravel will also handle scheduling `async` methods by using the `ScheduleAsync()` method. Note that this doesn't need to be awaited - the method or Func you provide _itself_ must be awaitable (as it will be invoked by the scheduler at a later time).

```c#
scheduler.ScheduleAsync(async () =>
{
    await Task.Delay(500);
    Console.WriteLine("async task");
})
.EveryMinute();
```

> You are able to register an async method when using `Schedule()` by mistake. Always use `ScheduleAsync()` when registering an async method.

## Scheduling Invocables

To learn about creating and using invocables [see the docs.](./Invocables.md)

To schedule a invocable, use the `Schedule` method:

```c#
scheduler
    .Schedule<GrabDataFromApiAndPutInDBInvocable>()
    .EveryTenMinutes();
```

What a simple, terse and expressive syntax! Easy Peasy!

_Note: Coravel also supports queuing invocables too!_

### Sample: Scheduling An Invocable That Sends A Daily Report

Imagine you have a "daily report" that you send out to users at the end of each day. What would be a simple, elegant way to do this?

Using Coravel's Invocables, Scheduler and Mailer all together can make it happen!

Take this sample class as an example:

```c#
public class SendDailyReportsEmailJob : IInvocable
{
    private IMailer _mailer;
    private IUserRepository _repo;

    // Each param injected from the service container ;)
    public SendDailyReportsEmailJob(IMailer mailer, IUserRepository repo)
    {
        this._mailer = mailer;
        this._repo = repo;
    }

    public async Task Invoke()
    {
        var users = await this._repo.GetUsersAsync();

        foreach(var user in users)
        {
            var mailable = new NightlyReportMailable(user);
            await this._mailer.SendAsync(mailable);
        }        
    }
}
```

Now to schedule it:

```c#
scheduler
    .Schedule<SendDailyReportsEmailJob>()
    .Daily();
```

**Woah!** How readable and maintainable could **your** system be by using Coravel?

## Scheduling Tasks Dynamically

While this is not necessarily recommended, it is possible.

You may schedule tasks by using the `IScheduler` interface. Just inject the interface wherever DI is available.

Keep in mind that dynamically scheduled tasks will disappear after the running application has terminated due to re-deployment, etc.

## Schedule Workers

What if you have longer running tasks - especially tasks that do some CPU intensive stuff? Normally, this may prevent other scheduled tasks that are due from running until the CPU intensive task(s) are completed.

Schedule workers solves this problem! 

A schedule worker is just a pipeline that you can assign to your tasks - each worker is executed on it's own dedicated thread(s) so you can make your schedules more efficient and scalable.

To begin assigning a schedule worker to a group of scheduled tasks use `OnWorker(string workerName)`:

```c#
scheduler.OnWorker("worker1");
// The following are all assigned to "worker1".
scheduler.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Hey, I'm on worker1!"));
scheduler.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Me too!"));

scheduler.OnWorker("worker2");
// The following are all assigned to "worker2".
scheduler.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("These might be long running tasks?"));
scheduler.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("And they won't cause worker1's tasks..."));
scheduler.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("... to wait until these are done!"));
```

This is useful when using Coravel in a console application, for example. In this case, you can choose to scale-out your scheduled tasks
however you feel is most efficient. Any super intensive tasks can be put onto their own worker and therefore won't cause the other scheduled tasks to lag behind!

## Intervals

First, methods to apply interval constraints are available.

These methods tell your task to execute at certain intervals. They are basically all wrappers of the `Cron` method (keep reading...). 

For example, `Hourly` will run on the hour, every hour (`0 * * * *`).

`Daily` will run at midnight each day (`0 0 * * *`).

- `EveryMinute();`
- `EveryFiveMinutes();`
- `EveryTenMinutes();`
- `EveryFifteenMinutes();`
- `EveryThirtyMinutes();`
- `Hourly();`
- `Daily();`
- `Weekly();`
- `HourlyAt(int minute)`
- `DailyAtHour(int hour)`
- `DailyAt(int hour, int minute)`

_Please note that the scheduler is using UTC time. So, for example, using `DailyAt(13, 00)` will run your task daily at 1pm UTC time._

### Cron Expressions

You can use the `Cron()` method to supply a cron like expression.

```c#
scheduler.Schedule(
    () => Console.WriteLine("Scheduled task.")
)
.Cron("00 00 1 * *"); // First day of the month at midnight.
```

Supported expressions are:

- "\*" matches every value (`* * * * *` - run every minute)
- "5" supply the literal value (`00 13 * * *` - run at 1:00 pm daily)
- "5,6,7" matches each value (`00 1,2,3 * * *` - run at 1:00 pm, 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm daily)
- "5-7" indicates a range of values (`00 1-3 * * *` - same as above)
- "\*/5" indicates any value divisible by the value (`00 */2 * * *` - run every two hours on the hour)

## Day Constraints

After specifying an interval, you can further chain to restrict what day(s) the scheduled task is allowed to run on.

All these methods are further chainable - like `Monday().Wednesday()`. This would mean only running the task on Mondays and Wednesdays. Be careful since you could do something like this `.Weekend().Weekday()` which basically means there are no constraints (it runs on any day).

- `Monday()`
- `Tuesday()`
- `Wednesday()`
- `Thursday()`
- `Friday()`
- `Saturday()`
- `Sunday()`
- `Weekday()`
- `Weekend()`

## Prevent Overlapping Tasks

Sometimes you may have longer running tasks (longer than 1 minute). The normal behavior of the scheduler is to simply fire off a task if it is due.

What if the previous task is **still** running?

In this case, use the `PreventOverlapping` method to make sure there is only 1 running instance of your scheduled task.

```c#
scheduler
    .Schedule<SomeInvocable>()
    .EveryMinute()
    .PreventOverlapping("SomeInvocable");
```
This method takes in one parameter - a unique key (`string`) among all your scheduled tasks. This makes sure Coravel knows which task to lock and release ;)

## Further Restrict When Tasks Run

Using the `When` method you can add additional restrictions to determine when your scheduled task should be executed.

```c#
scheduler
    .Schedule(() => DoSomeStuff())
    .EveryMinute()
    .When(SomeMethodThatChecksStuff);
```

If you require access to dependencies that are registered with the service container, it is recommended that you [create an invocable](./Invocables.md) class and perform any further restriction logic there.

## Global Error Handling

Any tasks that throw errors **will just be skipped** and the next task in line will be invoked.

If you want to catch errors and do something specific with them you may use the `OnError()` method.

```c#
provider.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
    // Assign your schedules
)
.OnError((exception) =>
    DoSomethingWithException(exception)
);
```

You can, of course, add error handling inside your specific tasks too.

## Logging Executed Task Progress

Coravel uses the `ILogger` .Net Core interface to allow logging scheduled task progress.

In your `Startup.cs` file, you need to inject an instance of `IServiceProvider` to the constructor and assign it to a member field / property:

```c#
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, /* Add this */ IServiceProvider services)
{
    Configuration = configuration;
    Services = services;
}

public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

/* Add this property */
public IServiceProvider Services { get; }
```

Next, do the following:

```c#
provider.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
{
    // Assign scheduled tasks...
})
.LogScheduledTaskProgress(Services.GetService<ILogger<IScheduler>>());
```

The `LogScheduledTaskProgress()` method accepts an instance of `ILogger<IScheduler>`, which is available through the service provider.

## On App Closing

When your app is stopped, Coravel will wait until any running scheduled tasks are completed. This will keep your app running in the background - as long as the parent process is not killed.
